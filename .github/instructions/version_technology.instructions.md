# Version and Technology Preferences

- Always use the latest version (2025 or current year).
- Do not recommend outdated versions.
- Python default: 3.12+.
- For GUI, always use PySide6, not PyQt.

## Reasoning

These rules ensure compatibility, security, and user preference. Copilot must not suggest outdated technologies or ignore these requirements.
