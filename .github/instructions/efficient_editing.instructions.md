# Efficient Editing Mandate

- Make all necessary changes in one comprehensive response.
- Do not make small edits per line or per function.
- Do not split changes across multiple responses.
- Combine all modifications into a single complete file edit.

## Reasoning

Efficient editing prevents quota exhaustion and ensures all changes are applied at once. Copilot must not split edits.
