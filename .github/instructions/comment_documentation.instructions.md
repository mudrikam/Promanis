# Comment and Documentation Standards

- Do not add change-tracking, removal, or TODO comments without request.
- Only add meaningful functional documentation.
- Documentation comments must be in clear, easy-to-understand English.
- Do not use comments for version control or change tracking.
- Focus on the reason (WHY), not technical details of the change.

## Reasoning

Comments should clarify intent in plain English, not track changes. Copilot must not add unnecessary comments or use comments for version control.
