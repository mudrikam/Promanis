# Code Modification Approach

- Do not use placeholder comments like `// ...existing code...`.
- Do not omit any existing code sections when editing.
- Always provide the entire file content when editing.
- Include all functions, variables, and logic.

## Reasoning

Placeholders risk code loss. Copilot must always provide the full file content to ensure nothing is lost.
