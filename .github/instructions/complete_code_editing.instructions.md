# Complete Code Editing Mandate

- Do not use placeholders for existing code.
- Always include the entire file content when editing.
- If you cannot include all code, do not make the edit.

## Reasoning

This prevents code loss and ensures all logic is preserved. Copilot must never use placeholders or partial edits.
